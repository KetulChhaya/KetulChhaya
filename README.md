# HELLO, I’m Ketul Chhaya

I’m a full-stack software engineer who enjoys building systems. Currently I'm working on open-source LLM integration setup for keeping users' intellectual property in-house. Over the last 2 years I’ve worked across product features, backend systems, AI infrastructure, and internal tooling. I’m especially drawn to problems around performance, reliability, and cost-awareness in modern applications.

## What I Focus On

I tend to gravitate toward work that involves:

* Backend and API design
* Observability and usage tracking
* Performance and cost optimization
* Developer tooling and internal infrastructure
* Building user-centric frontend

## Selected Work

### **1. TokenWise Tracker**

**TypeScript · Node.js · SQLite · Firebase · MongoDB**

Published on [https://www.npmjs.com/package/tokenwise-tracker] 

I built TokenWise after running into a common problem: AI features are easy to ship, but hard to observe and control once real users start hitting them. This package acts as a lightweight proxy around OpenAI calls and captures token usage, latency, model metadata, estimated cost, custom application-level metadata (for analyzing purpose)

It’s designed to be **non-intrusive** : no large refactors or framework lock-in. Under the hood, it uses JavaScript Proxies to intercept calls while keeping application code clean.

### **2. Formula-V : F1 Performance Visualization Platform**

**React · D3.js · Python · Kaggle F1 Dataset**

Visaulizations available at: https://formula-v.netlify.app

An interactive data-visualization project focused on making complex Formula-1 performance data understandable through web-based visual analytics wherein I processed and merged multi-table F1 race datasets (drivers, constructors, lap times, results, qualifying) to build analysis-ready data models for visualization 

Built interactive D3.js visualizations (Sankey flows, sunburst hierarchies, line charts, stacked area charts) enabling users to explore driver trends, constructor dominance, and race dynamics.

### **3. Parallel Integer Factorization (Pollard’s Rho & P-1)**

**C · GMP · POSIX Threads**

A systems-focused project where I parallelized classical factorization algorithms to work on large composite numbers.

The interesting part wasn’t just the math but it was a task coordinating threads efficiently in my machine (MAC)

It was a deep dive into how algorithmic ideas meet real hardware constraints.


### **4. Vehicle Detection & Traffic Intensity Prediction**

**Python · Computer Vision · ML Pipeline**

An end-to-end project where I built a pipeline from vehicle detection to traffic intensity estimation. A key learning here was evaluating models using the right metrics (precision/recall tradeoffs) instead of relying on raw accuracy, especially with imbalanced data.


## Tech I Use Regularly

**Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, C, HTML/CSS
**Backend:** Node.js, REST APIs, async systems
**Databases:** MongoDB, Firebase, SQL variants
**Frontend:** React
**Infra & Tooling:** Git, CI/CD, AWS, testing frameworks

I’m interested in Full Stack SWE roles

Grazie, Ciao!
